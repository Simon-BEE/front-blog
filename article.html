					<p>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.
					I have a dark side, too. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

					I have a dark side, too. Tell him time is of the essence. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? You all right, Dexter?

					I'm partial to air conditioning.
					I'm really more an apartment person. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm partial to air conditioning. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

					Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.
					I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
					I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>

						<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.
						I like seafood. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

						Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.
						I have a dark side, too.</p>

					<p>Only you could make those words cute.
					You're a killer. I catch killers. Keep your mind limber. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Cops, another community I'm not part of.

					Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm really more an apartment person. I have a dark side, too. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Only you could make those words cute.</p>

					<p>You're a killer. I catch killers. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

					Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. You're a killer. I catch killers. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Like a sloth. I can do that. Keep your mind limber.

					I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. God created pudding, and then he rested. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>

					<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm generally confused most of the time.

					This man is a knight in shining armor. You look…perfect. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.

						<p>Tell him time is of the essence. You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I have a dark side, too.
